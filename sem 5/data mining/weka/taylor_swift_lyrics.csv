Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,"Ha, time for a little revenge",2,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and,3,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,"I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him",4,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause",5,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,She took him faster than you can say sabotage,6,2010

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling,21,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things,22,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,23,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,24,2010
